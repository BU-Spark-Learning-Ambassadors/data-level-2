# Data Prep & Visualization Level Two Microchallenge

## What is a micro-challenge?
- A micro-challenge is a small task or project designed to be completed within a specific time frame. It promotes learning through hands-on coding experience. This micro-challenge's purpose is to help you practice data preparation and visualization using Python and the **Iris dataset**. If you aren’t familiar with these concepts, our Level One walkthrough is a great place to start.

## Difficulty = ★☆☆

## What you will build:
- A Python script that loads, cleans, and transforms the **Iris dataset**, then creates basic visualizations. You’ll work with commonly used visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.

## How you will build it:
- You will fill in the blanks in the provided code. Some tasks, such as handling missing data and outliers, will involve filling in appropriate columns or methods. For visualization tasks, you will create plots to explore key features of the data.

## Duration:
- Less than a day 

# Instructions

## 🚀 Setup
1. **Clone this repo** into your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BU-Spark-Learning-Ambassadors/DataPrepVisualization_LevelTwo.git
   ```
   
# Instructions
## 🚀 Setup
- Clone this repo into your local machine

## 🏆 Challenge
- Create histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize relationships in the data.
- The structure of the code and several functions are already provided — read over the code before you start!
- Try perforiming similar functions with another dataset you find online.

## 🛟 Need Help?

Go to the [Spark! Space](https://www.bu.edu/spark/resources/space/) and ask any student employee for a **Learning Ambassador** that can help with a micro-challenge.
